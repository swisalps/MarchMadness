rA = rating for team A
rB = rating for team B
Y = random variable representing the margin of victory for a particular game between teams A and B
E[Y] = rA - rB. E[Y] should be the expected value for Y
y = the observed margin of victory between teams A and B

===========
n = number of teams
xJ = independent predictor variable for team j (1 <= j <= n). xJ can be -1, 0, or 1.
Y = margin of victory
yI = margin of victory for game i
yI = xI * 1R1 + xI * 2R2 + ... + xI * nRn + eI = xIr + eI

error term eI for a particular game i: eI = yI - (rA - rB)
